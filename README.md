# Quiz Laurea Gabri
This project is a simple web application that allows a single user (Gabri) to play a quiz while the others can watch what he's doing.

The app is divided in 2 parts:
 - the server (in `/backend` folder)
 - the web GUI (in `/frontend` folder)

Each one is packaged with a simple Dockerfile. To run it locally, simply run `docker-compose up`.
